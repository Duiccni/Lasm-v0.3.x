# LASM v0.3.1 (On Work)
Lime Assembler
This is a simple **32-bit x86 assembly** language written in **Python 3.11.5**.
Its supports basic x86 instructions and some advanced commands.
Its also has a lot of features that make it easy to use, such as:

* Syntax highlighting
* Code completion
* Error checking
* A built-in debugger

Note: I used Black Foröatter for making code more Prettier.

Code has 3 main codes:

* main.py (Main thread.)
* variables.py (Variables, constants, colors and settings.)
* function.py (Basic functions like toInt(x) for converting string to int.)
* instruction.py (Complex commands and instructions.)

## Getting Started

To get started, you will need to install Python 3.6 or later
Once you have Python installed, you can clone the LASM repository from GitHub:

```
git clone https://github.com/Duiccni/Lasm-v0.3.x.git
```
